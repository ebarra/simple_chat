            Stylesheets and Preprocessors
            ==============================

            You can always bring in CSS files manually with `<link>` tags, or asynchronously
            using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can take advantage
            of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

            By default, stylesheets from your `assets/styles` folder are included
            here automatically (between STYLES and STYLES END). Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less)
            are supported. In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into
            a single file.

            To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
            For example, here are a few things you could do:

                + Change the order of your CSS files
                + Import stylesheets from other directories
                + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus

        <!--STYLES-->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/importer.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/main.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/normalize.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/normalize.min.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/fonts/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css">
        <!--STYLES END-->

        Client-side Templates
        ========================

        HTML templates are important prerequisites of modern, rich client applications.
        To work their magic, frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Ember, and Knockout require
        that you load these templates client-side.

        By default, your Gruntfile is configured to automatically load and precompile
        client-side JST templates in your `assets/templates` folder, then
        include them here automatically (between TEMPLATES and TEMPLATES END).

        To customize this behavior to fit your needs, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
        For example, here are a few things you could do:

            + Import templates from other directories
            + Use a different template engine (handlebars, jade, dust, etc.)
            + Internationalize your client-side templates using a server-side
              stringfile before they're served.
    -->

    <!--TEMPLATES-->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/jst.js"></script>
    <!--TEMPLATES END-->


    <!--

      Client-side Javascript
      ========================

      You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
      on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
      take advantage of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

      By default, files in your `assets/js` folder are included here
      automatically (between SCRIPTS and SCRIPTS END).  Both JavaScript (.js) and
      CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported. In production, your scripts will be minified
      and concatenated into a single file.

      To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
      For example, here are a few things you could do:

          + Change the order of your scripts
          + Import scripts from other directories
          + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript
